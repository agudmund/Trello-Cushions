Current

Something else (e.g. improve __init__.py, add type hints, etc.)

Make code more concise

Add type hints to drop_area

Include unit test for drop_area

Start refactoring the big process_file method (split into smaller helper methods, maybe decorate with @log_call)
Other (e.g. add __init__.py to dialogs/, improve icon saving filename, etc.)

Start cleaning up process_file in the main window
(split it into smaller methods like _create_board(), _add_cards(), etc.)
Other (e.g. add type hints, centralize stylesheet strings, etc.)

Start refactoring the big process_file method
(split into smaller private methods, better error handling, maybe use @log_call
)
Minor polish (centralize colors/fonts, add type hints, etc.)
Something else you have in mind

Refactor/split the big process_file method into smaller private methods
Add basic error handling improvements or user feedback in case of API failure
Start thinking about configuration (e.g. board name, list name, delay time as settings)
Minor cleanups (centralize colors, fonts, remove unused imports, etc.)

Split/refactor the big process_file method in main_window.py (e.g., into _parse_file(), _upload_to_trello(), etc.)
Centralize styles/colors/fonts (e.g., into a styles.py or constants dict to avoid repeated stylesheet strings)
Add basic config options (e.g., customizable board name, list name, card prefix via settings dialog)
Improve error handling (e.g., more specific messages for API failures, retry logic)
Other ideas (e.g., add unit tests, make parsing smarter for markdown headings)

To make future moves like this less error-prone, you could create a tiny app.py or central import file for common Qt things, but for now this is perfectly fine.

Where to next? (pick your adventure)Here are the most natural follow-ups now that the structure is stable:Polish the parser / card creation  Make splitting smarter (respect markdown headings as card titles, code blocks, lists, etc.)  
Custom card prefix ("Note 1" → configurable)  
Better truncation / formatting for descriptions

Refactor process_file
Split the big method into smaller private ones, e.g.:  _parse_text_to_paragraphs()  
_create_trello_structure()  
_add_cards_with_progress()  
Add better error recovery (skip failed cards, show partial success)

Add real configuration  Move board name, list name, card prefix, delay (0.6s), desc max length into a settings file or dialog  
Save/load via JSON (like we already do for icon)

Visual / UX love  Centralize colors, fonts, shadows into a styles.py or constants  
Add subtle animations (fade-in progress, success confetti via canvas-confetti if we ever go web)  
Tray icon / minimize to tray (nice for a popup utility)

Quality of life  Add type hints throughout  
Basic unit tests (e.g. for parsing, API helpers)  
Make the window resizable or add a preview pane for parsed cards before upload

Big swing ideas (if you're feeling adventurous)  Local preview mode: show cards in a mini-kanban inside the app before uploading  
Support multiple files or batch upload  
Export back to markdown from Trello (reverse flow)

A few low-to-medium effort ideas that usually feel rewarding right after a big cleanup:Smarter parsing
Instead of just splitting on double newlines, detect markdown headings (#, ##) as card titles and the following paragraph(s) as description. Bonus: preserve code blocks, bold/italic, lists inside cards.
Configurable basics
Add a tiny settings expansion: board name, list name, card prefix (“Note {i}” → “Review item {i}” or whatever), delay between cards (0.6s is polite but maybe user wants faster/slower). Save to a proper config.json instead of hardcoding.
Preview before upload
After parsing, show a quick scrollable list or mini-kanban of what cards would be created (title + first 100 chars of desc). “Looks good? Upload” button. Catches typos/mistakes early.
One-click retry / partial success
If some cards fail (rate limit, network blip), don’t just swallow it — show which ones failed and offer “Retry failed cards” or “Continue anyway”.
Make it feel more “cushiony”
Add a subtle fade-in for the progress bar, or a gentle color pulse on success. Nothing heavy — just enough to match the name.
