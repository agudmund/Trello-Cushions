Auto-label cards (e.g., color-code by length or keywords)  

Drag multiple files: Drag .md/.txt file into the dashed area (or click "Browse File")
Allow dropping several .md/.txt files at once → process them in sequence or create separate boards.

Want to add "Open last board" button (remembers URL from settings file)?  
Remember the last board URL in a small settings file → add "Open Last Board" button below "Browse File" → one click to revisit your pile.
Add button to open Trello board directly

Integrate with Notion API

Make one single cushion slowly breathe (scale 1.0 → 1.03 → 1.0 over 10–15 seconds, random phase per cushion) — just so the pile looks quietly alive when you glance over  
Add a tiny "morning light" vignette that gently brightens the center of the canvas over the first 30 minutes of runtime (very subtle gradient overlay)  
Randomly sprinkle one extra leaf or speck on the background every few minutes (so the paper texture keeps evolving imperceptibly)  
Implement breathing animation for cushions

--------------------

Yes, I’m 100% with you now. This is already a beautifully polished little vanity project wrapped in an adorable amount of over-the-top coziness:Dark cozy theme (#1e1e1e + warm accent #8a7a67)
Emoji-only toolbar buttons (  ) with hover glow
Fixed 500×400 window because “why would anyone resize perfection?”
Shadow effect on the whole central widget
Persistent custom app icon via json sketchbook_settings
Drag-or-browse .md/.txt → split on double-newlines → one Trello card per paragraph
Artificial 0.6s sleep per card → theatrical slow-motion progress
Creates fresh board + “To Review ” list every single time
Offers to open the board in browser at the end

So the surface-level mission is already clear:“Turn any wall-of-text markdown note into a luxurious, artisanal Trello board with one card per paragraph — delivered at the speed of a very relaxed sloth so you can savor the vibes.”

Make the artificial delay adaptive / mood-based
→ longer delays when the paragraph contains sad words, shorter when it has “vibe check passed” energy
Randomly rename the board to unhinged motivational / passive-aggressive titles
→ “Emergency Brain Dump 2026 ”, “Things I’ll Ignore Tomorrow”, “Paragraphs That Deserve Better Than This File”
Instead of one list, auto-create multiple mood-themed lists and sort paragraphs into them via cursed heuristics
(urgent / cozy / existential dread / shopping list energy / etc.)
Add fake “AI insights” as card comments or labels
(really just emoji + random buzzword salad)
Turn the progress bar into performance art
→ fills normally → then slowly drains backwards at the end while saying “reflecting…” → fills again
Every 5–7 runs: secretly create a second invisible board whose name is just the current date + one unicode sparkle → never tell the user
Add a hidden “chaos mode” toggle in settings that does something monumentally pointless but visually satisfying (confetti on every card? reverse paragraph order? cards named after sea creatures?)
Make the drop area display live ASCII art previews of what the Trello board will roughly look like (very badly)

Expand mood-based delays

Incorporate ASCII art previews

Make list more whimsical

B. Other low-hanging cozy improvements (optional today)Add a small "Current icon:" prefix to the label in settings
Make the dialog slightly taller/wider if you plan to add more settings soon (e.g. delay slider, log level, chaos toggle)
Consistent button styling across app (you already have good CSS snippets)

C. What to do after cleanupOnce the above is in place and tested (open settings → pick icon → close → restart app → icon persists?), we can finally move to more fun gremlin territory:Implement daily rotating log file (trello_log_YYYY-MM-DD.txt) as promised in the feature list
Make board name dynamic/unhinged
Add a chaos toggle somewhere
Or whatever stupid glorious idea is bubbling up next

Your call — do you want to apply the cleanup above first (especially moving save/load into the dialog), or jump straight to the next feature? Paste any error you hit after changes, or just say "looks good, next"
